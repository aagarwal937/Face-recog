<h1> FRI (Face Recognition and Identification)</h1>

You can detect faces and identify all of them. You need to training it for detect faces. Now you're thinking how can I train it? So let's start. 

## Getting Started

First of all you have to install modules for opencv

### Prerequisites
You should set up python before commands for opencv

### Installing

These commands are for the install opencv and modules for opencv.
```
pip install opencv-python
```
```
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```
```
pip install opencl
```
```
pip install pillow --upgrade
```

## Final step
When you did previous steps you can add the images for train of code.
Let's create new folder which is name is your name and add the your 6 or a lot of images to that folder.
Now you can write command for the training of code with your images.

Let's write these command to commandline

```
python faces-train.py
```

```
python faces.py
```

When you write these commands to commandline you will see the new frame which is taking you video, detect your face and identify your ID

### Note for everyone
Absolutely you can develop this project and create ne issues of code
