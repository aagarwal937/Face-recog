# Face-recog
In order to build our OpenCV face recognition pipeline, we'll be applying deep learning in two key steps.
>> To apply face detection, which detects the presence and location of a face in an image, but does not identify it.
>> To extract the 128-d feature vectors (called “embeddings”) that quantify each face in an image.
